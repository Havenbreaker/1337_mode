# 1337_mode - Updated for FW-1.0.2
Dark "1337 mode" CSS Config for Pineapple Nano

SSH to your WiFi Pineapple Nano and place "main.css" in the following directory "/pineapple/css" . I recommend making a copy of the original just in case the format isn't for you so that you can easily revert to the normal CSS formating.
